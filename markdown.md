# What is Markdown:

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

You can add Markdown formatting elements to a plaintext file using a text editor application. Or you can use one of the many Markdown applications for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android operating systems. There are also several web-based applications specifically designed for writing in Markdown.
